Description: This package permits, from variables related to agricultural
    production, to generate static and dynamic Bayesian networks that
    allow forecasting crop results. The package allows comparing the 
    effectiveness of models generated from some network structure 
    learning methods. The networks are generated based on 
    functions available in the bnlearn (static networks) and 
    dbnR (dynamic networks) packages. The forecasting of the crop production
    can be done from sets of data geographically separated 
    (specific areas of the plantation) 
    and also from chronological cuts (phenological phases).
